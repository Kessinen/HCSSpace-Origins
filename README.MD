# HCSpace Origins
## WTF?
HCSpace Origins is a top down space shooter intended as a way for me to learn making games with the [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) engine. Still a complete noob with this whole game programming thing. I've only made a few snippets of code and small automations with python here and there.
## Legal Stuff
A few pointers. This gamecode comes without any warranty. Try this at your own risk and don't come complaining if your computer explodes in a huge fireball.

Secondly, Due to licencing, I cannot include any music in the repository. Binaries will have audio where implemented.
